This program is intented to work with a Bluetooth dongle connected to the robot and an Android phone running the [Blueberry remote control app](https://github.com/CalebJ2/Android-Bluetooth-Remote-Control/releases).

You will need to "allow unknown sources" to be able to install it.

To use it, pair your phone with the bluetooth module, connect to it in the app, click "touch control", then "start", and hopefully the center stick will act as a joystick to control the car.
